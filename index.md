# OpenPlaceGuide Africa Tile Server

We provide a vector and raster tile server covering all Africa at https://africa.tiles.openplaceguide.org/. The tile data is updated minutely.

## Terms of use

* You can use the server for your non-commercial or commercial project.
* Do not use it excessivly. Excessive use might be trottled. [Contact us](mailto:info@addismap.com?subject=OpenPlaceGuide+Africa+Tiles) if you plan using it for a bigger project.
* Prefer using vector tiles of raster tiles - they cause much less server load.
* We do not guarantee for availability and the terms of usage might change in the future.
* Have fun and make OSM in Africa grow!
